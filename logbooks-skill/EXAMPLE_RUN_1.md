# Example Logbook Template

This logbook is intended to perform a simple but parameterized "Hello World" operation, and demonstrate the flexibilty of combining formal parameters with looser natural-language instructions.

## Hello World Example

Execute the following python snippet (after parameter substitution):

```python
print("Hello, Richard!")
```
Results:
```
Hello, Richard!
```
