# Example Logbook Template

This logbook is intended to perform a simple but parameterized "Hello World" operation, and demonstrate the flexibilty of combining formal parameters with looser natural-language instructions.

## Hello World Example

Execute the following python snippet (after parameter substitution):

```python
print("Hello, Richard!")
```

Modified to be extra friendly and casual as requested:

```python
print("Hey Richard! What's up, buddy? Great to see you! 😊")
```

Results:
```
Hey Richard! What's up, buddy? Great to see you! 😊
```
